    event based vs thread based architecture:
    Thread-based:
    Har kaam ke liye nayi thread. Easy programming, lekin zyada resources lagte hain.

    Event-based:
    Sab kaam ek thread me events ki list ke through hota hai. Zyada scalable, thoda tricky code.

    Process:
    Independent program, apna memory space, apna address space.

    Thread:
    Process ke andar chota unit, same memory share karta hai.
    Nginx:
        1- Event-based architecture use karta hai.
        2- Ek hi thread me multiple connections handle kar sakta hai.
        3- Lightweight aur efficient hai, isliye zyada requests handle kar sakta hai.
